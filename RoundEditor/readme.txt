Round Editor

This is an external tool that will be used to create files for the rounds we will use in our horde mode. All files written out of or loaded
into this tool will be binary (.dat) files. The binary files will contain the types and locations of all the enemies of the round. If there
are any issues or bugs with this tool, or any other features or additions that you feel should be in this tool, please let me know.

Descripton of the user interface and what you can do with this tool

Create Enemy: Creates a label of an enemy on the screen. These labels can be dragged around and repositioned using the mouse. The text
for the label will depend on what enemy type you have selected in the list box next to the button. 
Clear Button: Clears the list of enemies and all the labels on the screen. This will clear the current round you have.
Load Round: Allows a user to load in a .dat file for a round and view or edit it. Loading a round WILL CLEAR THE CURRENT ROUND. Save
the round you are working on before loading another round in order to avoid losing work.
Save Round: Allows a user to save the current round as a .dat file.
