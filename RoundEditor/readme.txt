Round Editor

This is an external tool that will be used to create files for the rounds we will use in our horde mode. All files written out of or loaded
into this tool will be binary (.dat) files. The binary files will contain the types and locations of all the enemies of the round. If there
are any issues or bugs with this tool, or any other features or additions that you feel should be in this tool, please let me know.

Descripton of the user interface and what you can do with this tool

Add Enemy 1-5: Adds a label for an enemy onto the screen depending on the enemy number you choose. You can drag the enemy around by left
clicking and holding. Enemies can be deleted by right clicking them.
Save Round: Allows a user to save the current round as a .dat file. 
Load Round: Allows a user to load in a .dat file for a round and view or edit it. Loading a round WILL CLEAR THE CURRENT ROUND. Save
the round you are working on before loading another round in order to avoid losing work.
Clear Round: Clears the list of enemies and all the labels on the screen. This will clear the current round you have.
